      <h3>A Brief Bio</h3>
      <p>
        As a creative maker of many things, my attention is now focused on the
        area that has given me the most joy throughout my life...
        programming/coding. It is said that if you are doing what you love, you
        will never have to work, and I have always found that to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
        My analytical/technical training and education, (including functional
        programming, IT support, metal fabrication and woodworking), mixed with
        an artistic creativity have always provided a sound basis for software
        development. It allows me to exercise both sides of the brain. Perhaps
        being ambidextrous is a happenstance of that.
      </p>
      <p>
        As team player I understand the value of respecting and appreciating my
        co-workers. There is rarely a problem that they can not help you solve.
        Lastly, my age and extensive work history have taught me how to be a
        productive and valuable employee.
